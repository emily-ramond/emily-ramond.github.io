- Our purpose in this project is to provide a platform that allows underrepresented musical artists from around the world to be seen while simultaneously allowing users to explore and discover new music that still fits within their musical palette.
- In order to achieve this purpose, we built a music recommender app based upon machine learning methods that mitigates regional bias allowing for global representation while also prioritizing user satisfaction.
- Overall, our hope is to start creating a more fair and equitable music industry promoting cultural diversity.
