- The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in criminal justice, particularly in pretrial risk assessment, has raised concerns about bias. These algorithms predict the likelihood that a defendant will miss court or reoffend, affecting decisions such as bail eligibility. While intended to reduce human bias, they often reflect and amplify systemic inequalities in policing and arrest records. Ethical AI requires auditing models for biased error rates and outcomes. Without proper oversight, these systems can worsen inequalities instead of addressing them, ultimately eroding public trust in the legal system. Responsible AI in pretrial decisions must ensure fairness and accountability.
