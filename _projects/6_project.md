- Studies in sociology and media studies have revealed a gender gap in the film industry, with an underrepresentation of female directors in film production.
- The implications of this disparity on recommendation systems are not widely researched.
- Most studies look at bias from a statistical perspective (e.g., popularity bias).
- Many content distribution platforms (like Netflix) utilize recommendation models for personalized user content.
- A recommender system filters information (e.g., user and item data) to provide personalized suggestions to users.
- We investigate whether this gender bias is embedded into various recommendation models, developed using different similarity metrics and algorithms.
- Our aim is to develop a fair movie recommender system that minimizes biases associated with the directorâ€™s gender.
