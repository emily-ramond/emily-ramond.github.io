Held a talk with the business and technology club at the University of Washington, discussing all things data science and consulting! :sparkles:

We answered questions such as...
- What has consulting taught you?
- What skills from data science were directly applicable?
- What is your favorite and least favorite part about your job?
- How do you see artificial intelligence transforming the consulting world?
- Any advice for undergraduate students?

I followed the Q&A with a networking session, providing advice to students as they approach graduation.
