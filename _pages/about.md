Hello, I'm Emily! I completed my undergraduate studies at HDSI in 2022, where I was an active member of Marshall College. My capstone project centered around causal inference. Post-graduation, I joined Deloitte as a Business Technology Analyst, later promoting to Consultant / Data Scientist. Drawing inspiration from my coursework at Marshall College, I am passionate about ethical artificial intelligence. My commitment extends to prioritizing fairness, transparency, and accountability. I am driven by my interest in leveraging the power of data science for the betterment of the world. Let's chat!

Beyond academic and professional pursuits, I love crocheting, travel, snowboarding, and fostering cats.
